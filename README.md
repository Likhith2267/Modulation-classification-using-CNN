# Modulation-classification-using-CNN
Developed a CNN model to classify the modulation type from received signals at receiverâ€™s end. Developed the project in 2 stages.

STAGE 1 : Classified the model using a huge dataset of modulation types named RadioML 2016.10b dataset, comprising synthetic radio signals with various modulation types.

STAGE 2: Created a custom dataset of 14,000 constellation images with 13 different modulation types at various SNR levels using Python. Achieved 91% accuracy in modulation classification with a CNN model.


For the above source code we classified the CNN model by using the dataset created by us which consists of different constellation images of different modulation types .
